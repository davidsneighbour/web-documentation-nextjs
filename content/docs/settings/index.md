# Settings

## Overview

Most of Front Matter is configurable to your needs. In this part of the documentation all settings
are explained.

## Settings view

On the Front Matter CMS dashboard, you can find the settings view. This view allows you to configure
the common settings of the CMS.

> **Info**: You find also a link to get a full diagnostic of your settings. This is useful when you
> want to troubleshoot your settings or know what the CMS is loading.

## Team settings and local settings

Since version 4 of Front Matter, Team settings got introduced. Teams settings allow you to have all
settings on the project/solution level. You will be able to override them on user/local level
(`.vscode/settings.json`).

The purpose of team settings is to share the global configuration of your CMS configuration. This
way, your whole team can use the same tags/categories but apply their changes locally.

As you do not typically share your `.vscode/settings.json` configuration, we went for a
`frontmatter.json` file on the root of your project/solution. The settings you provide in this JSON
file are the same as you can configure on a local level. This allows you to easily copy, move
settings from team to local level and vice versa.

> **Info**: The `frontmatter.json` file can be placed anywhere in your project/solution. The CMS
> will automatically detect it.

## Migrate local settings to team settings

To allow you to easily migrate already defined settings, you can run the
`Promote settings from local to team level` command. The very first time, it will also ask you if
there are settings that can be promoted.

![On startup, Front Matter checks if settings can be promoted][01]

## Splitting your settings in multiple files

Some of the Front Matter settings can be split in multiple files to make management of these easier.
For example, in case you are using multiple content-types for your site, you can now split each
content-type to its own file. This allows you to easily manage the settings for each content-type.

> **Important**: The configuration of the `frontmatter.json` file will override the settings which
> you might have splitted.

### Supported settings to split

The following settings are supported to be split in multiple files:

| Setting name                        | Folder path                                    | JSON Schema                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frontMatter.content.pageFolders`   | `./.frontmatter/config/content/pagefolders/`   | `https://frontmatter.codes/config/content.pagefolders.schema.json`   |
| `frontMatter.content.placeholders`  | `./.frontmatter/config/content/placeholders/`  | `https://frontmatter.codes/config/content.placeholders.schema.json`  |
| `frontMatter.content.snippets`      | `./.frontmatter/config/content/snippets/`      | `https://frontmatter.codes/config/content.snippets.schema.json`      |
| `frontMatter.custom.scripts`        | `./.frontmatter/config/custom/scripts/`        | `https://frontmatter.codes/config/custom.scripts.schema.json`        |
| `frontMatter.data.files`            | `./.frontmatter/config/data/files/`            | `https://frontmatter.codes/config/data.files.schema.json`            |
| `frontMatter.data.folders`          | `./.frontmatter/config/data/folders/`          | `https://frontmatter.codes/config/data.folders.schema.json`          |
| `frontMatter.data.types`            | `./.frontmatter/config/data/types/`            | `https://frontmatter.codes/config/data.types.schema.json`            |
| `frontMatter.media.contentTypes`    | `./.frontmatter/config/medIa/contenttypes/`    | `https://frontmatter.codes/config/media.contenttypes.schema.json`    |
| `frontMatter.taxonomy.contentTypes` | `./.frontmatter/config/taxonomy/contenttypes/` | `https://frontmatter.codes/config/taxonomy.contenttypes.schema.json` |
| `frontMatter.taxonomy.fieldGroups`  | `./.frontmatter/config/taxonomy/fieldgroups/`  | `https://frontmatter.codes/config/taxonomy.fieldgroups.schema.json`  |

> **Important**: The folder path is relative to the root of your project/solution and you create the
> files in their corresponding folder. The file name is the same as the `id` of the setting.

You can use the JSON schema to validate and get intellisense for the settings. Use it as follows:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://frontmatter.codes/config/content.pagefolders.schema.json"
}
```

### Example of splitting a setting

#### Example 1: Specify a blog page folder

Example of specifying a page folder in a separate file:

```markdown
| .frontmatter
| - config
| -- content
| --- pagefolders
| ---- blog.json
```

Contents of the `blog.json` file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://frontmatter.codes/config/content.pagefolders.schema.json",
  "title": "blog",
  "path": "[[workspace]]/blog"
}
```

#### Example 2: Specify a custom data type

You are also able to define sub-folders for your settings, that way, you can easily group your
settings. For example, in this case we'll create a `baz` data type in its own folder.

```markdown
| .frontmatter
| - config
| -- data
| --- types
| ---- bar
| ----- baz.json
```

Contents of the `baz.json` file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://frontmatter.codes/config/data.types.schema.json",
  "id": "hugo.params.baz",
  "schema": {
    "title": "Baz Site Parameters for hugo-toroidal",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "First": {
        "title": "First Property",
        "description": "First Baz",
        "type": "string",
        "default": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Extending settings

You can extend the settings of Front Matter by using the `frontMatter.extends` setting. This allows
you to extend the settings from a custom local or remote location. This can be useful if you want to
share a common set of settings across multiple projects.

### Example

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://frontmatter.codes/frontmatter.schema.json",
  "frontMatter.extends": [
    "https://platen.io/frontmatter/platen.json",
     "./config/frontmatter.config.json"
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Extending with code

You can also extend the settings with a custom JavaScript module/file. This functionality allows you
to extend the settings with more dynamic settings. For instance, you can use this to load settings
based on the current machine.

Create a new JavaScript file in your project. For instance, `frontmatter.config.js`.
Here is an example of how you can extend the settings:

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD013 -->
```javascript {{ "title": "frontmatter.config.js", "description": "Example of integrating .env support" }}
const path = require('path');
require('dotenv').config({
  path: path.join(__dirname, `.env`)
});

module.exports = async (config) => {
  return {
    ...config,
    "frontMatter.preview.host": process.env.FRONTMATTER_PREVIEW_HOST
  }
}; 
```

Once the file has been created, you can reference it in your `frontmatter.json` file:

```json {{ "title": "frontmatter.json" }}
{
  "frontMatter.config.dynamicFilePath": "[[workspace]]/frontmatter.config.js"
}
```

## Reviewing composed settings

You can inspect your composed settings with the [diagnostic logging][02] command, which shows you
the [Complete frontmatter.json config][03] in a virtual Markdown document. Use that output to verify
that your split configuration settings are applied the way you expect.
